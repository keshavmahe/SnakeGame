Snake Game
Overview
This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java using the Swing library for the graphical user interface. The game features a snake that moves around the board, growing in size each time it consumes food. The goal is to keep the snake alive by avoiding collisions with itself and the edges of the board while collecting as much food as possible to increase your score.

Features
Snake Movement: Control the snake using the arrow keys.
Dynamic Gameplay: The snake grows longer with each food item consumed.
Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the edges of the board.
Score Tracking: The current score is displayed based on the snake's length.
Interactive Graphics: The game is visually appealing with grid lines, 3D effects for the snake and food, and smooth animations.
How to Play
Start the Game: The game starts automatically when you run the program.
Control the Snake: Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake:
Up Arrow: Move Up
Down Arrow: Move Down
Left Arrow: Move Left
Right Arrow: Move Right
Objective: Guide the snake to the food that appears randomly on the board. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and your score increases.
Avoid Collisions: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.
Game Over: The score is displayed when the game ends. You can restart the game by running the program again.
